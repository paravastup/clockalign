## ProductHunt Description

### The Problem

We've all been there:
- The 7am standup that's actually 11pm for your Singapore colleague
- The "quick sync" that hits someone's graveyard shift
- The same person ALWAYS getting the short end of the timezone stick

Traditional scheduling tools find when everyone is "free." But free ≠ functional. Someone waking at 3am isn't going to contribute their best thinking.

### The Solution: ClockAlign

ClockAlign finds **Golden Windows** — times when your distributed team isn't just available, but actually **cognitively sharp**:

🌟 **Golden Windows Engine**
- See a heatmap of when each team member is energized
- Get ranked recommendations for best meeting times
- Quality scores tell you: "This slot is 85% golden"

💔 **Sacrifice Score™ Tracking**
- Every meeting time has a "pain score" based on local hour
- 10am = 1 point. 11pm = 10 points.
- Leaderboard shows who's absorbing the timezone burden
- Fairness alerts when someone's score is 3× the average

⚡ **Smart Energy Curves**
- Set your chronotype (early bird / normal / night owl)
- Customize your personal productivity rhythm
- ClockAlign respects that "available" ≠ "sharp"

### Key Features

✅ Team management with invite codes
✅ Per-user timezone + energy preferences
✅ 24-hour heatmap visualization
✅ Best times ranking with explanations
✅ Sacrifice leaderboard with trends
✅ Fairness alerts + imbalance detection
✅ Works across any time spread (even 17+ hours!)

### Who It's For

- Remote-first companies with global teams
- Engineering teams spread across continents
- Anyone tired of 3am "mandatory" syncs
- Leaders who care about sustainable meeting culture

### The Philosophy

We built ClockAlign on three principles:

1. **Energy > Availability** — A meeting where someone's half-asleep is a waste of everyone's time
2. **Fairness through visibility** — You can't fix timezone inequity if you can't see it
3. **Async-first mindset** — Sometimes the answer is "don't have this meeting"

## Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
Tired of someone on your team always getting the 3am meeting slot?

We built ClockAlign to fix that. 🌍

It finds times when your global team isn't just "available" — but actually ENERGIZED.

Let me explain how 👇

**Tweet 2:**
Most scheduling tools ask: "When is everyone free?"

Wrong question.

"Free" at 7am when you went to bed at 2am isn't really free.

ClockAlign asks: "When is everyone free AND sharp?"

**Tweet 3:**
🌟 Golden Windows

Every person has an energy curve — when they're peak productive vs. running on fumes.

ClockAlign maps these across your team and finds the overlap where EVERYONE is functioning well.

Not just available. Functional.

**Tweet 4:**
💔 Sacrifice Score™

We track the "pain" of every meeting time:
- 10am local = 1 point (easy)
- 8pm local = 4 points (dinner time)
- 2am local = 10 points (career damage)

Your team's Sacrifice Leaderboard shows who's bearing the burden.

**Tweet 5:**
The leaderboard isn't about guilt.

It's about visibility.

When Sarah has 3× the team's average sacrifice score, you KNOW the meeting rotation isn't fair.

Now you can fix it.

**Tweet 6:**
We also show fairness alerts:

⚠️ "Bob has attended 12 graveyard-shift meetings this quarter"

🚨 "APAC team members are at 4× the sacrifice average"

You can't improve what you can't measure.

**Tweet 7:**
Sometimes the answer is: no golden window exists.

A team spread across Tokyo, Berlin, and SF has maybe 2 hours of decent overlap.

ClockAlign shows you this truth — and suggests going async instead.

That's valuable data too.

## LinkedIn Post

**Headline:** We've been scheduling global meetings wrong.

I used to manage a team across 4 continents. Every week, SOMEONE had to join a call at 11pm or 6am.

The same people. Every. Single. Time.

They never complained. They just... got quieter in meetings. Less engaged. Eventually burned out.

When I finally asked, one engineer said: "I assumed this was just what working at a global company meant."

It doesn't have to be.

**That's why we built ClockAlign.**

Most tools ask: "When is everyone available?"

ClockAlign asks: "When is everyone available AND actually sharp?"

The difference matters. A meeting where someone's half-asleep at 3am isn't collaboration — it's theater.

**How it works:**

🌟 **Golden Windows** — Maps each person's energy curve and finds times when the WHOLE team is functioning well, not just present.

💔 **Sacrifice Score™** — Quantifies the "pain" of bad meeting times. Early morning = 3 points. Graveyard shift = 10 points. Track who's bearing the burden.

⚠️ **Fairness Alerts** — Get notified when someone has 3× the team average. You can't fix inequity you can't see.

**The result?** Teams that actually rotate the inconvenience fairly. Meetings scheduled when people can THINK, not just dial in.

If you lead a distributed team, you owe it to them to make timezone pain visible.
