## 🎯 POSITIONING (Best of All 3)

### The Killer One-Liner
> **"Calendly schedules a meeting. ClockAlign schedules a team."** (GPT)

### Alternative Headlines
- "Stop making Tokyo take the midnight calls." (Opus)
- "Fair meetings for global teams" (Opus)
- "Schedule Smarter, Not Harder—Fairness Built In" (Gemini)

### Core Differentiator
ClockAlign isn't another scheduler—it's the **fairness layer** for global teams.

| Tool | What It Does | ClockAlign Difference |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Calendly | Books individual meetings | Doesn't track WHO sacrifices |
| World Time Buddy | Visual timezone comparison | No fairness, no energy weighting |
| Doodle | Group polls | Treats 5AM = 2PM (no energy awareness) |

### Messaging Pillars
1. **Fairness** - "Stop punishing the same teammates with 7am meetings"
2. **Energy** - "Optimize for human performance, not just overlap"
3. **Async-first** - "Know when NOT to meet"
