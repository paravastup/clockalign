# Getting Started with ClockAlign

Welcome to **ClockAlign** — the meeting scheduler that makes global team coordination fair and painless. 🌍

This guide will help you get up and running in under 5 minutes.

## What is ClockAlign?

ClockAlign helps distributed teams schedule meetings by:

1. **Finding Golden Windows** — times when everyone is available AND at their best energy
2. **Tracking Sacrifice Scores** — making the "pain" of inconvenient meetings visible and fair
3. **Nudging toward async** — suggesting when a meeting could be an email instead

No more guessing who's getting shafted by that 7am standup!

2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Sign in with your email (magic link) or Google account

### Step 2: Set Your Timezone & Preferences

First stop: **Settings**. This is crucial for accurate scheduling.

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Set your **timezone** — ClockAlign auto-detects it, but double-check
3. Choose your **chronotype**:
   - 🌅 **Early Bird** — Most productive in the morning
   - 🕐 **Normal** — Peak energy mid-morning to early afternoon
   - 🦉 **Night Owl** — Hit your stride later in the day
4. Set your **work hours** — When you're generally available
5. (Optional) Fine-tune your **energy curve** — Customize exactly when you're sharpest

### Step 3: Create or Join a Team

**Creating a Team:**
1. Go to **Teams** → **New Team**
2. Enter a team name (e.g., "Product Engineering")
3. Add a description (optional)

5. Share the **invite code** with your teammates

**Joining a Team:**
1. Get an invite code from your team admin
2. Go to **Teams** → **Join Team**
3. Enter the code
4. Done!

### Step 4: Find Your Golden Windows

Now the magic happens:

1. Go to your team's page
2. Click **"Find Best Times"**
3. ClockAlign analyzes everyone's timezones and energy preferences

The **Golden Score** tells you how well-aligned the team's energy is at that time. Higher = better.

### Step 5: Schedule a Meeting

2. Add meeting details (title, duration, agenda)

## Understanding the Dashboard

Your dashboard shows at a glance:

- **Your Teams** — Quick access to all your teams
- **Upcoming Meetings** — What's on your calendar
- **Your Sacrifice Score** — How much you've sacrificed this month
- **Quick Actions** — Create a meeting, find golden windows

---

## Key Concepts

### 🌟 Golden Windows

The overlap periods when everyone on your team is:
- Actually available (not blocked)
- At decent energy levels (not zombie hours)

The **Golden Score** (0-100%) tells you how "golden" a time slot is:
- **80%+** — Excellent alignment, everyone's sharp
- **65-80%** — Good, solid choice
- **50-65%** — Acceptable, someone might be in a post-lunch slump
- **Below 50%** — Consider async instead

### 💔 Sacrifice Score™

A number that quantifies meeting "pain":
- Meetings during your peak hours = low score (1-2 pts)
- Meetings at 7am or 9pm = higher score (3-5 pts)
- Graveyard shift meetings = maximum pain (10 pts)

Your team's **Sacrifice Leaderboard** shows who's bearing the brunt. If someone's score is way higher than average, it's time to rotate meeting times!

### ⚡ Energy Curves

Everyone has a personal productivity rhythm:
- When you're sharp (peak hours)
- When you're okay (normal hours)  
- When you're running on fumes (off-peak)

ClockAlign uses this to find times when the WHOLE team is energized, not just available.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be honest about your energy** — There's no point saying you're sharp at 7am if you're really not
2. **Set realistic work hours** — Don't mark yourself available 24/7
3. **Check the leaderboard** — Make sure no one's consistently getting the short end
4. **Rotate meeting times** — If you MUST have bad-time meetings, share the pain
5. **Trust the Golden Score** — An 85% slot beats a 60% slot every time
